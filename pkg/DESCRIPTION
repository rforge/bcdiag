Description: Diagnostic tools based on two-way
        anova and median-polish residual plots for Bicluster output
        obtained from packages; "biclust" by Kaiser et al.(2008),"isa2"
        by Csardi et al. (2010) and "fabia" by Hochreiter et al.
        (2010). Moreover, It provides visualization tools for bicluster
        output and corresponding non-bicluster rows- or columns
        outcomes.  It has also extended the idea of Kaiser et al.(2008)
        which is, extracting bicluster output in a text format, by
        adding two bicluster methods from the fabia and isa2 R
        packages.
